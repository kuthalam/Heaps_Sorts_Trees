By: Mukundan Kuthalam <br />
Purpose: Exam 2 for 422C <br />
Includes code to: <br />
  Add elements, remove elements, and sort heaps. <br />
  Contains code to perform Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort (Quick Sort also?). <br />
  Recursive BST traversal problems exist but the code should finally insert and preOrder, postOrder, and inorder traverse BSTs. <br />
*Still a work in progress*
